xuedi 2.1 is so much fun! Was running all night without an issue, Could test 
most of the features. The random dancing on the bar easteregg was quite 
entertaining. But it stopped working suddenly and powered down. 

### company R
we are using xuedi since version 1.7 there have been gradual improvements to 
its function and feature set. But the new direction version 2.0 went got 
problematic specially with the 2.1 release. But all those issue where luckily
resolved in the patch set 3.0.

### friend D
xuedi is generally an OK product, but it definitely could be improved up on 
when rewritten in rust
